# Midi Blows!!

An Arduino USB Breath Controller using cheap as components.

Ingredients:

- 1x Arduino Pro Micro
- 1x BME280 Pressure Sensor
- 1x 10ml Syringe

Recipe:

- Wire it all up via I2C like it was a weather station.
- Get a syringe. Something like 10ml (ok size) or 20ml (Bit big. Feels a bit like blowing something else ðŸ˜†). Drill a tight whole into it for the cable and put the sensor into it.
- Map the CC to your VST parameter, and blow into it while playing your midi keyboard.

## Tips

- Some VST have an expression control to map the controller to. If not, maybe just map it to the instrument's volume or filter cutoff frequency.

## Possible Improvements

- Play with the oversampling settings to reduce latency further down from the current 12ms.
